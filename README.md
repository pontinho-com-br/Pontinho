# Pontinho

This project was created to track the games of Pontinho we play at home. For more information about the game itself check [here](http://www.wikarta.com/pt/titulo/Pontinho).  

I initially created using Angular 1.4 + .NET 4.6. I'm in process of migrating to Angular 2 + .NET Core with EF Core.


## Next Steps

* Migrate all Angular components to Angular 2  
* Ensure Identity Works  
* Move to Token Autentication
* Secure Routes  
* Configure Continuous Deployment
